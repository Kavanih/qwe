      Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through
      education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the
      son of a mine worker can become the head of the mine, that a child of
      farm workers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we
      make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one
      person from another.

        All hands is a web3 decentralized protocol that aims to raise funds to
        provide learning materials for schools in Africa. This project plans
        on eradicating poverty in Africa by wiping out illiteracy. Our goal is
        to raise funds that will be used to upgrade schooling and provide
        students with up-to-date learning materials. When you give to ALL
        HANDS Foundation, 100% of your donation goes straight to our mission
        to continue providing humanitarian aid to children education. We are
        striving to reach those hardest to reach, but can not do it alone, We
        need ALL HANDS TOGETHER.

        Without our cryptocurrencies donors, programs could not be possible.
        The funds we received helped us start the provision of free learning
        facilities. We aim to support every unfortunate children within our
        reach with school supplies, scholarships to orphans girls in secondary
        school, construction of toilet blocks to end open defecation in the
        public schools and health outreaches. Donating cryptocurrencies to the
        organizations that accept crypto will help Africa to defeat poverty.
        100% of your cryptocurrency donations go to charitable projects. Your
        support is needed to keep our initiatives going.

          Due to research estimate, over 85% failure of students are due to
          lack of standard learning facilities like textbook,library, standard
          learning room, well equipped laboratory and so on. The
          confortability of learning environment has lots of impact to play on
          student`s attention. Most students stands in class or sits on the
          floor to receive lectures and stress their posture and distract
          their learning due to disconfort.Through our project, we hope to
          bring educational opportunities and improved lives for thousands of
          African students.

          ALL HANDS Foundation is a non-profit organization that started an
          operation with the goal of helping African countries to defeat
          poverty by providing assistance in different fields such as
          education, health, and economic empowerment. Unfortunately, gaining
          access to a proper education is challenging to underprivileged
          children, especially for women and young girls in Africa as a result
          of poverty. Crypto donations are advantageous to develop African
          education systems and build infrastructures.

      Education is the key to unlocking a brighter future for those in
      Nigeria. Sadly, many students can’t get proper education due to lack of
      resources that will provide a better learning experience for them in
      schools. This is where crowdfunding comes in. We want to launch a
      crowdfunding project that will help African students be able to get the
      quality education they deserve and give them the opportunity to change
      their lives.
